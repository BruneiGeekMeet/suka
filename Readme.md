The Tutong District Volunteer Group, commonly known as ‘Sukarelawan Daerah Tutong’, was established on February 2 2015 with the aim of providing assistance to the community through volunteer work. Sukarelawan Tutong is under the auspices of Tutong District Office and has volunteers to do community work throughout Tutong District. Based on having solid visionary and integrity as the foundation of their organisation, Volunteers of SUKA comprises of students, youths, civil servants and retirees. Among the activities that SUKA has provided are helping the people whose homes have been affected by floods and landslides. Besides that, SUKA also provide support for underprivileged families, orphans, elderlies and the disabled.

**Problem**
- Disseminate information or events to the Bruneian communities from one district to another.
- Necessities given in the form of charity by Bruneian communities to be given out to the people whom need it.
- Not much Bruneians are aware of SUKA and the activities held by them.
- Difficulties in disseminating clothing donated by the public as well as not having an inventory system to check for.
